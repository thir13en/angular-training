# Angular Santiloopz Training

This is a repository for keeping a register out of my lousy memory of the things I find handy to know in Angular.  
You can find a [bunch of notes and drafts](notes/index.md) that are constantly updated with new things. As you can see,
the notes are in `markdown`, please, feel free to participate in this repo and PR if you feel it is useful for you.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.0-rc.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
