# Redux

### You probably don't need Redux, here's when you will need it
* Multiple parts of your app display differently the **same data**
* Some data can be **simultaneously edited** by both the user using the UI or events coming from the backend via server push
* You have a **need for undo/redo** of at least part of the application state
