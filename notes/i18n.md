# Internationalization


### Angular Built in method
You start by adding the `i18n` custom attribute to a html element to mark it as
translatable.
```angular2html
<button i18n>A text</button>
```
Then run in the terminal
```shell script
ng xi18n
```
And a `messages.xlf` file will be generated in the `src` folder of the
project. The `xlf` format is an `xml` format special for translations. This file
contains the translation strings identified by an id which is a hash resulting from an
operation applied to the name of the file it belongs to, and the string contained 
by the marked html element.  
You can also provide some extra information to the translator.
```angular2html
<button i18n="meaning of the text | this after the pipe will be added as a description">A text</button>
```
A change in the meaning will also trigger a new id generated in the `xml` file, not
so a change in the description.  
Even further, you can also provide a custom `id` that will be reflected in the `xml` document.
```angular2html
<button i18n="meaning | description @@ customIdentifier">A text</button>
```

### Pruralization
We use the following syntax
```angular2html
<div i18n>{
    itemsCount,
    prural,
    =0 { No items available }
    =1 { One item available }
    other { {{ itemsCount }} items available }
}</div>
```

### Alternative Expressions
Used to give the translator a lot more context on the translated strings,
basically states that the set of expressions relate somehow.
```angular2html
<div i18n>
    {
        propertyThatContainsAlternatives,
        select,
        BEGINNER { Beginner }
        INTERMEDIATE { Intermediate }
        ADVANCED { Intermediate }
        
    
    }
</div>
```
This is an alternative syntax to `*ngSwitch`.
